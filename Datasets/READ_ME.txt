This Supporting Information is part of the PLOS ONE submitted article "Image-based Obstacle Detection for Lake-Deployed Small Autonomous Surface Vehicles Using a Single-Board Computer", by P. Pacccaud and D. A. Barry (2017).

The presented datasets are available for comparing different algorithms and assessing their performance.

Each dataset includes the measured attitude and delay between the frames. This is recorded in the file IMU.txt with the following format:

Roll [rad] | Pitch [rad] | delta Time [s]

Delta Time corresponds to the elapsed time between the current frame and the previous one.

Data are 'as is', they are as recorded and are not modified in any way.
